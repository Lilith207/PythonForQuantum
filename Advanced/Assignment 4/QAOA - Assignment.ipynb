    "Ill be very honest, I dont have a good idea of what im doing. But in qaoa_optimal you can find my attempt at an optimization algorithm, for some reason you do need to adjust the multiplier and dampener for every graph, as the bigger it is, the closer the multiplier and dampener should be to eachother. But it does work, it seems to be even more accurate than COBYLA when tuned correctly, this tuning could probably be done automaticly, but i have no idea how id do that. this works decently."
