When quantum computers are mentioned, your mind will most likely go to some very specific tasks they are good at. For example cracking RSA encryption via Shor's algorithm. If you have heard at least that much about them. \\
\\
But, what would the use be of a QPU? A quantum processing unit. A device which could do gate operations and fit inside of a desktop PC. What programs could benefit from that? These are the questions which will be looked at in this paper.\\

%In the early 1980's, Richard Feynman proposed that a quantum computer would be
%an effective tool with which to solve problems in physics and chemistry, given
%that it is exponentially costly to simulate large quantum systems with
%classical computers (\cite{feynman1982simulating}).

This research paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:task} offers
the definitions used and the software which will be looked at Section~\ref{sec:processor} describes the working aspects those pieces of software are based upon and what of these aspects could be more efficient due to quantum. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we state the conclusion to all this research.
