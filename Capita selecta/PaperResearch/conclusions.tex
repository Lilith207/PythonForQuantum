\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In conclusion, there are pieces of common software out there which could benefit from a QPU. But, often, this software will already have an acceptable performance. Meaning that it would not be necessary. But one piece of software sticks out, games, it could be very possible that a desktop QPU could improve the performance of games, or in this case, Counter-Strike 2. Which could mean that when a desktop QPU is developed and commercialized, it would become an asset for a new generation of computers.
