Moreover, you will have to setup your own [QuantumCircuit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#quantumcircuit) because we are not going to use only 2-qubit quantum system. Hence, your solution should include the complete setup process to create and simulate the requested quantum circuit.\n",
