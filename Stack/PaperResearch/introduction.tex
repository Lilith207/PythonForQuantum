\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
As quantum computers are known today, they are big bulky machines which can take up entire rooms. Well, the devices themselves commonly are not this big, but all the equipment which accompanies really adds up. So a similar process might be expected for the quantum computer, it will shrink in size until it can fit in your pocket.
\\\\
This paper aims to explore the possibilities of shrinking current technology in size to let it fit within a desktop computer. Where this small quantum computing device will be referenced to as a QPU, Quantum Processing Unit. Something akin to a GPU. Where the aim is to design one with as few assumptions and leaps in technology as possible.

The second chapter will talk about what current technology is out there and determine which would be the most fitting for a QPU. Chapter 3 will delve into what current technology is used to let a motherboard communicate with a GPU and how it could be replicated. Chapter 4 will take a look at what modules would be necessary for the QPU to work and combine all of these into a full design and chapter 5 will bode the conclusion to the previous chapters and results.
