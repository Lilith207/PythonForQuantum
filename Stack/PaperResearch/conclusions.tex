\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In conclusion, a room temperature QPU which can fit in a desktop should be possible by current technologies. In fact, there is a company out there which is currently working on this. They are called Quantum brilliance, an Australian-German company. They currently have a server rack sized quantum computing unit out which has 5 Q-bits and are working on a GPU sized version with around 50 Q-bits \cite{article1}. Meaning that this concept is not outside of the realm of the possible. Sadly a full, detailed design will not be possible as no data is available on how these chips would work, communicate and how much power they would draw.
